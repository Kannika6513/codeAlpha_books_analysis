#ðŸ“˜ Book Data Scraping & Analysis Project
This repository contains my work for a data analysis internship project where I scraped, cleaned, and visualized book data from the website Books to Scrape. The project is divided into three major tasks:

#Task 1: Web Scraping â€“ Extract Book Data
In this task, I built a Python-based web scraper using requests and BeautifulSoup to extract information from 50 pages of books listed on the BooksToScrape website. The data collected includes:

Title

Price (GBP)

Rating

Genre

The scraped data was saved in a structured format (CSV file) for further analysis.

ðŸ”„ I ensured all pages were iterated through and also scraped inner book pages to extract the genre field, making the dataset richer.

 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The main objective of Task 2 was to explore and understand the dataset. Key steps included:

âœ… Dataset loading and preview

âœ… Data type check using df.info()

âœ… Missing values check

âœ… Summary statistics of Price (describe())

âœ… Genre-wise average price calculation

âœ… Frequency counts for Ratings and Genres

âœ… Duplicate data check

âœ… Outlier detection using boxplots

ðŸ§  This task helped uncover data insights and check for data integrity before visualization.

ðŸ“ˆ Task 3: Data Visualization
Here, I visualized key patterns in the dataset using Matplotlib and Seaborn. The visualizations include:

Top 10 Genres by book count

Book count by Genre and Rating (grouped bar chart)

Genre vs Average Price

Rating vs Average Price

Top 5 most expensive books

Comparison of genres with the highest average price

Distribution of book prices

Count of books per rating level

ðŸŽ¯ All visualizations are designed to extract business or user behavior insights and enhance data storytelling.
